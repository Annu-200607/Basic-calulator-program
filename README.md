Banking System Mini Project (C + Advanced UI)
📌 Overview

This repository contains a Bank Account Management System developed as part of Task-4 (High Level – Mini Project).
The project demonstrates core banking operations using C programming along with a modern, advanced UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to combine strong backend fundamentals with a user-friendly frontend experience.

🖥️ How the System Works

The frontend provides a clean and interactive banking dashboard.

User actions (deposit, withdraw, balance enquiry) are handled in real time on the UI.

The backend C program implements the same banking logic using:

Structures to store account data

Functions for each operation

Switch-case for menu handling

This separation improves clarity, scalability, and understanding.

▶️ How to Run the Project
🔹 Run the UI (Frontend)

Download or clone the repository

Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome / Edge)

Use the banking dashboard

🔹 Run the C Program (Backend)
gcc bank.c -o bank
./bank
